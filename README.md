# Intro to GitHub Classroom
This example project is written in Python, and tested with [pytest](https://www.python.org/).

## The assignment

The test in [`hello_test.py`](hello_test.py) is failing right now because the function in [`hello.py`](hello.py) isn't outputting the correct string. Fix this function and run the `pytest` command in the terminal to make the tests green.

Next, open the "Source Control" button on the left sidebar, write a commit message, and commit and push your changes to GitHub.

After committing and pushing your changes, the autograder will run your tests and give you a grade. First, ensure you're signed into GitHub (you will be prompted with a dialogue box). To check your autograded scores, click on the GitHub Actions extension on the left sidebar, click the refresh button at the top-right corner of the sidebar, hover over the latest workflow run, and click the globe icon üåê. Next, click the "Autograding" job button, click the dropdown for the "Run education/autograding" step, and scroll down to see your grade.

If the GitHub Actions extension isn't working (e.g., `data provider not available`), navigate to your GitHub assignment repository directly, click on the `Actions` tab, and click on the latest workflow run. The link will be of the form¬†`https://github.com/ACC-HelloWorld/4-hardware-software-communication-GITHUB_USERNAME`, where `GITHUB_USERNAME` is replaced with your own. For example, if your GitHub username is `sgbaird`, the link would be `https://github.com/ACC-HelloWorld/4-hardware-software-communication-sgbaird`. If you have trouble finding it, you can also use the "find a repository" search bar (boxed in red in the image below) on your [GitHub homepage](https://github.com) after signing in.
